# **Description**
Welcome to Mazingira, an organization dedicated to tackling environmental degradation and promoting sustainability. At Ma, we are committed to addressing the critical issues affecting our planet's health. Our mission is to inspire positive environmental change and encourage collective action to preserve our planet for future generations. Through our initiatives and partnerships, we strive to foster a culture of environmental stewardship and raise awareness about the pressing need for sustainable practices worldwide.
# **Problem**
Environmental degradation is the disintegration of the earth or deterioration of the environment through the consumption of assets, for example, air, water and soil; the destruction of environments and the eradication of wildlife. It is characterized as any change or aggravation to natureâ€™s turf seen to be pernicious or undesirable. This process leads to the endangerment of the human race, however, there are limited resources to help combat this at this time.
# **Solution**
One of the ways the organization is looking to raise funds is by encouraging repeat donations. The goal would be to create a platform that allows users to donate to organizations such as this one regularly, to enable the organization to meet their goals. They are looking to create a product that automates the donation process by allowing donors to set up regular donations e.g monthly donations of stipulated amounts.
